# Linux Distributions

Linux distributions (distros) are packaged versions of Linux that combine the **Linux kernel** with system utilities, libraries, and package managers. Each distro is optimized for specific use cases such as **servers, cloud workloads, containers, security, or personal computing**.

For a DevOps engineer, knowing the landscape of Linux distributions helps in **choosing the right OS for infrastructure, automation, and production environments**.
