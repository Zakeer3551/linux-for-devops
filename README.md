# Linux Foundations for DevOps

This repository documents my structured understanding of **Linux fundamentals from a DevOps and cloud engineering perspective**.

Linux is the backbone of modern infrastructure — from CI/CD runners and container images to Kubernetes worker nodes and cloud virtual machines. A strong grasp of Linux internals is essential for troubleshooting, automation, security, and performance in real-world DevOps environments.

This repository focuses on core Linux concepts that directly impact how systems behave in production, how applications are deployed, and how infrastructure is operated at scale.

## Topics Covered

The repository is organized into focused sections covering:

- Linux fundamentals and core concepts
- Differences between Linux and other operating systems (from an operational view)
- Linux filesystem layout and directory structure
- User and group management
- File operations and permissions
- Commonly used text editing workflows (vi/vim)
- Process lifecycle and process management
- System monitoring and resource visibility
- Basic Linux networking concepts
- Disk and storage management

Each section is documented with the intent of **building a strong Linux foundation for DevOps, cloud, and platform engineering roles**.
